# Master Plan

## Step 1

The system is based on 2 things:

* a **virtual assistant** working with Assistant OS
* a **spark** placed in the house (optionnal)

### Wake up

The assistant can wake you up. It can even wake you up sweetly if it is linked to a spark.

You define your wake up time with simple english order like `wake me up every day at 7am`. Then when time comes, if you are at home and the spark is activated, then the music starts from the spark. In other case, it just notify the user to wake for now.

### Security

The assistant has several ways to protect you. The first way is the protection of your online accounts. Give your emails to the assistant. Turn on the online protection and every evening it will check if these emails are compromised.

### Meteo

Every morning, the virtual assistant gives the meteo of the day in the current location.
You can also ask directly the meteo for the current day.
