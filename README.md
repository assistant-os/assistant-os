# assistant-os

This project is an artificial intelligence to assist human beings in the recurrent tasks.


## Getting started

Be sure to have the following constants in your environment variables: **SLACK_API_TOKEN**, **COLOR**, **NAME**, **ICON_URL**, **MODULES**, **MODULES_PATH**.

Then start the artificial intelligence:

```javascript
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Setup


### Environment variables

You have 3 methods:

#### In the .env file

This project uses the [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) module. So you can create a .env file in the rootpath of the project.

#### In command line

You can use instead the following command line to start the artificial intelligence:

```javascript
$ SLACK_API_TOKEN=<...> COLOR=<...> ... npm start
```

#### Finally you can add the environment variables from your os.

This methods depends of your os or the web hosting.

For linux, the best way is to add the variables in the bashrc.
